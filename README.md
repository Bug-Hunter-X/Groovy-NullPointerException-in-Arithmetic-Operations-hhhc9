# Groovy NullPointerException in Arithmetic Operations

This example demonstrates a potential pitfall in Groovy when performing arithmetic operations with variables that might be null. Groovy's dynamic typing can lead to unexpected `NullPointerException` errors if you aren't careful about null handling.

The `bug.groovy` file shows code with a potential null pointer exception. The `bugSolution.groovy` provides a corrected version with proper null handling.
